# **Bird Hunt Game**

Bird Hunt is a fun and challenging game where you can test your shooting skills. When building the game, I was inspired by the famous Duck Hunt game. So, I created my own version of hunting different kind of birds. The game is easy and I hope you like it have fun.

- **NOTE** This game is designed to be played on a wider screen size. If you are using a mobile device or other small screen, please rotate your device to landscape mode to ensure optimal gameplay.

# **Typography and color scheme**

## **Colour Scheme**
 - The color scheme in Bird Hunt game is designed to create a sense of nostalgia and fun. The bright, primary colors are reminiscent of classic arcade games, and the overall aesthetic is simple and easy to understand. I used the blue background color with white text on the buttons to match the sky of the background image. I also used **#de7b29** Cherokee Dignity (shades) for the title, scores, results and the timer to help create a sense of excitement and challenge. 

## **Typography**
- The typography for the Bird Hunt game is clear and easy to read. I used "Pangolin" font which  is a sans-serif font that is designed for use in games. It is a high-contrast font that is easy to read on a variety of devices.
