# **Bird Hunt Game**

Bird Hunt is a fun and challenging game where you can test your shooting skills. When building the game, I was inspired by the famous Duck Hunt game. So, I created my own version of hunting different kind of birds. The game is easy and I hope you like it.
- **NOTE** For mobile/small screen users you have to rotate your device in order to play the game.

# **Typography and color scheme**

## **Colour Scheme**
...The color scheme in Duck Hunt is designed to create a sense of nostalgia and fun. The bright, primary colors are reminiscent of classic arcade games, and the overall aesthetic is simple and easy to understand. I used the blue background color with white text on the buttons to match the sky of the background image. I also used *** for the title, scores, results and the timer to help create a sense of excitement and challenge. 

## **Typography**
...The typography for the Bird Hunt game is clear and easy to read. I used "Pangolin" font which  is a sans-serif font that is designed for use in games. It is a high-contrast font that is easy to read on a variety of devices.
